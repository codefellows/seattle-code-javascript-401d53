# auth-api-d53

## My Approach for Task 1:
1. create repo
1. add starter code
1. add all of the configs
1. extract all files from the `api-server`, and bring them to the root of the new `auth-api` repo
1. `npm i` AND make sure that all the packages from BOTH package.json files are installed:  these are the packages that need to be added:  `npm i cors bcrypt base-64 jsonwebtoken` 
1. get proof of life on the `api-server` portion
1. insert `auth` folder (from the `auth-server`) into the new repo's `src` folder
1. make sure all is wired up and confirm things works!
1.  models - we need ONE `models/index.js`, so will need import users from `auth/models` into `src/models`
