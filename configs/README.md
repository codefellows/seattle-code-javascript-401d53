# package.json Notes

## For React Applications

To deploy your application at GitHub pages, you'll need to add a home page property to your package.json which points to the deployed base URL of your GitHub Pages site.

*NOTE: This will break deployments to other hosting services such as Netlify, Vercel, or AWS Amplify, so if you later wish to deploy there, remove this property completely.*

```json
{
  "homepage": "https://yourname.github.io/repository-name"
}
```

## Node / Express Applications

### For Tests

Your scripts section should have the following, so that you can easily run tests locally and in your CI.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "test": "jest --verbose --coverage",
    "test-watch": "jest --watchAll --verbose --coverage",
    "init:config": "sequelize init:config",
    "db:create": "sequelize db:create"
},
```

### For NPM Modules

If you are creating a module to deploy at NPM, you'll want a "bin" section that identifies the name of the global command to run and your .js file that runs when called.

```json
"bin": {
    "fetch": "index.js"
}
```

Additionally, that file should have as it's first line, so that it'll run without having to type "node filename.js" every time

`#!/usr/bin/env node`
