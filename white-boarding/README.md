### Some Important Concepts

- How to Traversal the structure of interest
- Types of Tree traversals (Binary and Binary Search Tree):
  - Depth First
    - preorder
    - inorder
    - postorder
  - Breadth First
- Find midpoint of a linked list (see class for whiteboard)
- Reverse  a linked list (in-place, or possibly with array)
- Remove a node from a linked list
- Binary Tree, traverse and do a thing
- Binary Search Tree, traverse and do a thing.  maybe balance an unbalanced tree or confirm that a tree is in fact a Binary Search Tree (hint remember what an in-order traversal should look like)
- know how to use `Set()` in JavaScript (it is HashTable technology).  see [warmup](../warmups/README.md)
- see the classes in 2nd half where someone has white boarded.  
do whiteboards, afterwards confirm code works in repl or another tool
