    1. Note the drawing of the example data structure in the [list.draw](https://replit.com/@rkgallaway/401d53-linked-list-traversal#list.draw) file
    1. Basic:  write a function that console.logs all of the node values
    1. Stretch:  write a function that takes in a callback function, traverses the linked list, and performs an operation on all of the node values

1. [Traverse a Tree](https://replit.com/@rkgallaway/tree-traversal-d53#index.js).  5 minute warmup
    1. Note the drawing of the example data structure in the [tree.draw](https://replit.com/@rkgallaway/tree-traversal-d53#tree.draw) file
    1. Basic: Write a function that uses a helper function to recursively traverses a tree and logs all of the node values.

1. HashTables:  
specifically know [how Set works in JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set/Set) - it should be enough.  it is O(1) lookup and doesn't allow duplicates
