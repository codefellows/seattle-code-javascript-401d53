### Using React Native and Expo to start an app

[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) | [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/)

```bash
npm install --global expo-cli
expo init my-project
cd my-project
npm start
```

This will open up the Expo app runner, which allows you to run your app on a real device, or a simulator (see notes below)
